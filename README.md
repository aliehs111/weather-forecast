# five-day-weather-forecast 

weather dashboard that runs in the browser featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS

## Overview

HTML file links to bootstrap which provides the styling.  Javascript calls api from openweathermap.org then dynamically creates the cards with attributes to display the current weather as well as the next five days.  When user types city name in the search input, the weather details are displayed; current conditions are prominent and the next five days are displayed below.

Day.js was used to manipulate the api data to display the five days in the future and the appropriate plugins and syntax were used per the documentation.  Similarly, documentation in Bootstrap helped choose attributes and ids for elements.
